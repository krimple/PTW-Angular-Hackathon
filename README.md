PTW-Angular-Hackathon
=================
This is the sample (incomplete yet mostly functional) sample applciation we wrote at the PTW hackathon on Tuesday April 8, 2014.  While not an in-depth application and not tied to a back-end, it does at least demonstrate the two-way data binding and MVC features of Angular, and provides some Jasmine-based unit tests.

The application has the following features:

* Simple data binding example with in-line editing of todo items.
* Hiding completed items from the view when the checkbox is clicked.
* Immediate saving of data if any data has been changed.
* Uses two controllers, a service, routing.
* Configured with Yeoman (YO! man)
* Uses Grunt for builds (use `grunt serve` to run the app, `grunt test` to run all tests, `grunt jshint` to check code, etc...  Before doing this run `npm install` and `bower install` to make sure you have your dependencies.
* Uses localStorage to store tasks in memory
* Uses Angular UI Bootstrap components to show a drop-down calendar, wrap each task with an alert

Use this as a springboard to add more elements, experiment with directives, go crazy. Fork and enjoy, no restrictions on the code as it's just really basic (and quite probably imperfect) samples.

Enjoy!
